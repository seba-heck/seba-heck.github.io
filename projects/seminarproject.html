    <h3> Abstract </h3>
    <p>This thesis presents a comprehensive evaluation of physics-based simulation frameworks
        for deformable object manipulation in robotics. The study focuses on benchmarking the
        performance of the simulation frameworks MuJoCo and Isaac Gym across various metrics
        such as rendering capability, memory usage, speed, and compatibility with open-source
        software. Through extensive testing and analysis, it was found that MuJoCo offers highly
        optimized simulations on single CPU cores, albeit with stability limitations. On the other
        hand, Isaac Gym provides GPU-accelerated solvers that excel in handling large meshes
        with stability and robustness. The choice between the two frameworks depends on the
        specific requirements of the application. While MuJoCo is suitable for a wide range of
        tasks with efficient CPU simulations, Isaac Gym is preferable for scenarios involving large
        deformable objects and reinforcement learning training.</p>
